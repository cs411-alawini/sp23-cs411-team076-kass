## Project Summary
Tokyo Olympics Schedule viewer & Metrics Manager (Olympicstop.com)
Any sport would require a website in this modern age where the fans or people can go and look up details about their favorite athletes or venues in general. We propose a solution that targets this use case and provides users with a tool to access the same information by allowing multiple search/filter features that will enable folks to quickly gather the information they want to review about their favorite sportsperson. 

In addition, we will let users see global-level stats and individual contributions (athlete, country, event, and more). This solution is proposed as a one-stop solution for folks who would like to gather more information quickly. 

The proposal aims to solve a fundamental problem by allowing users to engage more in the events even if they're not physically present in and around the stadium or do not have a subscription to watch the event live. We are a free-to-use website that lets users quickly glance or deeply review the stats they want to check by allowing them to filter on various parameters that suit their needs and have a summarised or detailed view.
